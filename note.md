#Ruby Note

Never use quotation marks with booleans.
In ruby you don't need to declare var as variable just enter variable name.

print is similar to prompt and console.log in javascript
puts is same execpt it puts brake after the statement.

uppercase = .upcase
lowercase = .downcase

# is for the comment

Use =begin and =end for longer comments similar to */ /*

gets = grabs what user has inputed and it creates new line after. Ex) print "What is your name?"
chomp = removes extra line
gets.chomp 

String interpolation
Use #{} to input your variable.
Ex) first_name = "Kevin"
puts "Your name is #{first_name}" = gives "Your name is Kevin"

capitalize = makes first letter cap and rest lower.

You don't put () for if statement in Ruby and you will need to type end to end the statement
Ex) if true 
        print true 
    end

else if = elsif

unless = is not true
